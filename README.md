# CSE455 Final Project: Plant Seedlings Classification

### Sunny Zheng, Yanfeng Cui, Melody Zhang
 
## What problem are you trying to solve?
Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish different plants from seeding. We plan to use computer vision and machine learning to effectively differentiate plants with different growth stages to help yield a better environment. Our goal is to create a classifier capable of determining a plantâ€™s species from a photo.

## What algorithms/techniques will you use?
We will use machine learning and neural networks in modeling plant seedling classification. We plan to build a predictive model with neural networks, feed the model with some sample data, and make some changes to hidden layers to raise the accuracy level. We might use different predictive models to test which one is the best fit. In the process of feeding data to models, we might need to extract features from the input image, and then feed the features into logistic regression classifiers and other models for comparison. Also, SVM is a popular machine learning model for classification that we might use in our project.

## What dataset(s)?
The Kaggle competition provides data (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/plant-seedlings-classification/data).
Images of 960 different plants of 12 species at several growth stages. In the dataset, there are 4750 images as the training set (80% as training and 20% as validation) and 794 images as the test set. 

## Any other useful information
Our project might change as we work on it. proceed.
